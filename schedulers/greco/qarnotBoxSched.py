This is the qarnot QBox scheduler


List of available mobos:
- availBkgd: for each QBox number of mobos that are too cold and are running CPU burn tasks to heat
  We start CPU burn if air_temp < target - 1                       start if diff >= 1
  We stop the CPU burn if air_temp > target + 1                    stop if  diff < -1
  We can start low and high priority tasks here as well

- availLow: for each QBox number of mobos that are too hot to run cpu burn and are probably idle (or running cpu burn)
  We can start low priority tasks if air_temp < target + 1         start low if diff >= -1
  We stop the low priority tasks there if air_temp > target + 3    stop low if  diff < -3
  We can start high priority tasks here as well

- availHigh: for each QBox number of mobos that are too hot to run low priority tasks
  We can start high priority tasks if air_temp < target + 4        start high if diff >= -4
  We stop high priority tasks if air_temp > target + 10            stop high  if diff < -10


When a task of higher priority is sent to a mobo that is already running something,
wait for all the datasets to arrive before stopping the execution of the current task.


#TODO when an event of type "machine_unavailable" is received
# we should mark the qrad/mobos as unavailable as well 

#TODO need to add a "warmup" time for booting the mobo when a new task is executed on it
