'''
This is the scheduler instanciated by Pybatsim for a simulation of the Qarnot platform and has two roles:
- It does the interface between Batsim/Pybatsim API and the QNode/QBox schedulers (manager)
- It holds the implementation of the Qarnot QNode scheduler (dispatcher)


Every 30 seconds from t=0 the QNode scheduler will be woken up by Batsim.
At this time, the QBox sched will be asked to update their state (cf function updateAndReportState of the QBox scheduler)

Every time the QNode sched will be woken up, a dispatch of the tasks in the queue will be performed after each event
in the message from Batsim was handled.


Notion of priority for tasks:
There are 3 major groups: Bkgd, Low and High
Each task has a certain numerical value of priority.

A task cannot preempt a task in the same priority group (even if its numerical priority is smaller)
but can preempt tasks from a lower priority group.


A job refers to a Batsim job (see batsim.batsim.Job)
A task or QTask refers to a Qarnot QTask (see qarnotUtils.QTask)
